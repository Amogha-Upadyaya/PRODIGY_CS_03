# PRODIGY_CS_03
The following repository documents the Task-03 assigned during my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

# Description
#### Aim
- Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Provide feedback to user on the password's strength

#### Features
- Analyzes password length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Assigns a password strength rating (Very Weak, Weak, Medium, Strong).
- Provides detailed feedback on areas for improvement.

# Usage
#### Run the program
- Save the ```main.py``` and ```pwd_checker.py``` files in the same directory.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing these files.
- Run the program by typing ```python main.py``` and pressing Enter.

#### Enter your password
- The program will display password guidelines and prompt you to enter your password.

#### Get feedback
